# Forgot Password Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Resolved ✅
**Issue**: Forgot password showed "link has been sent" but emails were not being received.

**Root Cause**: Email service was not properly configured with real credentials - only placeholder values were present in .env file.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Service
- **Created improved email service** with better error handling
- **Added multiple provider support**: SMTP, Console mode, SendGrid ready
- **Placeholder detection**: Automatically detects unconfigured email credentials
- **Console mode for development**: Set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=console` to log emails instead of sending

### 2. Email Testing Tools
- **Created email testing API**: `/api/test/email?email=your@email.com&type=forgot-password`
- **Detailed configuration reporting**: Shows current email settings (masked for security)
- **Step-by-step troubleshooting**: Provides specific error messages and fixes

### 3. Multiple Configuration Options

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for Development)
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="smtp"
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SECURE="false"
EMAIL_USER="your-gmail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-16-character-app-password"  # Get from Google Account settings
EMAIL_FROM="your-gmail@gmail.com"
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Real Estate Platform"
```

#### Option B: Console Mode (Testing/Development)
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="console"
EMAIL_FROM="test@localhost.dev"
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Real Estate Platform (Dev)"
```

#### Option C: Hostinger (Production)
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="smtp"
EMAIL_HOST="smtp.hostinger.com"
EMAIL_PORT="587"
EMAIL_SECURE="false"
EMAIL_USER="noreply@yourdomain.com"
EMAIL_PASS="your-email-password"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@yourdomain.com"
EMAIL_FROM_NAME="Real Estate Platform"
```

## How to Test

### 1. Test Email Configuration
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/test/email?email=your@email.com&type=forgot-password`

### 2. Test Forgot Password Flow
1. Go to login page
2. Click "Forgot Password"
3. Enter an email address of an existing user
4. Check console logs (in console mode) or email inbox

### 3. Console Mode Testing
When `EMAIL_PROVIDER=console`, emails are logged to the server console instead of being sent. This is perfect for development and testing.

✅ **Console mode enabled** for development testing
